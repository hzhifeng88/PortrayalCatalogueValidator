-> This check is only for IDs which begins with correct letters

3. Sheets with Color column(s) have valid colors (corresponds with the Colors Sheet)

-> Values must be Hexadecimal (from position 1)

5. Each line should contain values (no cell grouping).
-> Once a merged cell is found, message will be displayed and the rest of the checks will not run
-> Currently only implemented on PointSymbolizer Sheet. Not sure to duplicate code into other sheets or make function take in sheets as variables

6. Cells shouldnâ€™t contain newlines (no line breaks).
-> Two types of line breaks
	a. Null row
	b. Empty row
-> Once a line break is found, message will be displayed and the rest of the checks will not run
-> Currently only implemented on PointSymbolizer Sheet. Not sure to duplicate code into other sheets or make function take in sheets as variables


Other notes:

1. Only data rows from Colors sheet are being read in and store as objects

2. Applications can only accept.xlsx extension. But could not handle wrong .xlsx file.
